# 3Zone_Alarm_System
This project offers an exploration into the different approaches which can be taken when developing real-world applications for the ATmega32A (8-bit) microcontroller. This project involved the design and construction of a 3-zone alarm system similar to security systems which are present in countless buildings around the world. The primary aim of this venture was to create a fully functioning alarm controller able to simulate the functions that a user would expect to be present in a finished retail product. The secondary object was to develop an understanding of the pros and cons that exist when choosing to design and write microcontroller code in C compared to Assembler, and objectively uncover when one approach may be better than another. Overall, this project found that the scalability and ease granted when coding in C far outweighed the level of control that exists when coding in Assembler, however it did provide an insight into the times when one approach may be more favorable to the task at hand.
